              <p>
                My journey began as an Information Technology Specialist in the U.S. Army (2014-2018), where I served 
                as a Help Desk Team Chief in Colorado Springs and Information Systems Maintainer in Daegu, South Korea. 
                I led over 5,000 network moves, adds, and changes while managing $750,000 in communications equipment 
                with zero losses. I hold a Secret Security Clearance and developed strong leadership, problem-solving, 
                and customer service skills through both IT and hospitality roles.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Middle Tennessee State University 
                (3.1 GPA, expected May 2026) with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I also earned my Associate of 
                Science in Computer Science from Nashville State Community College in May 2024. My technical foundation 
                includes coursework in Linux Essentials for Cybersecurity, Data Algorithms & Structures, Python for 
                Business Applications, Security Plus, Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking, and Data Analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                My military experience includes maintaining and troubleshooting network infrastructure (enterprise switches, 
                routers, firewalls), ensuring secure communications using government encryption and key management systems, 
                and performing installations on cybersecurity devices. I supported both classified and unclassified networks, 
                managing enterprise VoIP phone systems and wireless access points. I completed Advanced Skills & Leadership 
                Course in IT at Ft. Gordon, GA and Structured Self-Development Course at Ft. Bliss, TX.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond tech, what matters most is spending time with my wife and family. I&apos;m also a die-hard 
                Florida State Seminoles fan üç¢ ‚Äî nothing beats game day! I love getting outdoors for hiking and 
                nature photography, hitting up live concerts and music festivals, and gathering with friends to 
                watch football. Life&apos;s about balance: code hard, play harder, and cherish the moments with 
                loved ones.
